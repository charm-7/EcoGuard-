User Input (Simulated Symptom Analysis):
"The tomato plant leaves are yellowing, starting from the lower leaves and moving up. I also notice a V-shaped yellow area at the edge of the older leaves, and the veins inside the yellowed area remain green. The fruit production has slowed down."

*1. Diagnosis* : Likely Issue & Urgency
The symptoms described‚Äîinterveinal chlorosis (yellowing between the veins) starting on the older, lower leaves, with the veins remaining distinctly green‚Äîare highly characteristic of a Potassium Deficiency (K) in the tomato plant. The severity is Moderate, as the deficiency is already affecting older growth and slowing fruit production.

Urgency: Medium. While not an immediate threat to the plant's life like a fast-moving fungal disease, a persistent Potassium deficiency will significantly reduce fruit size, flavor, and overall yield, and it compromises the plant's ability to resist disease and stress. Immediate corrective action is necessary to save the current harvest.

2. Treatment Plan: Step-by-Step Resolution
A. Immediate Action (Within 24 Hours):

Foliar Feed: Apply a liquid fertilizer high in Potassium (a 'bloom' or 'fruit-set' formula, e.g., NPK ratio of 10-20-30 or similar) as a foliar spray directly to the leaves. This provides a quick, temporary fix as the plant can absorb the nutrient directly.

B. Soil Correction (Within 1 Week):

Soil Test (Recommended): If possible, test your soil's pH and nutrient levels. Potassium deficiency is often linked to low pH or an imbalance with other nutrients like Calcium or Magnesium.

Apply Potassium Source: Amend the soil around the plant with a slow-release source of Potassium. Good options include:

Sulfate of Potash (Potassium Sulfate, K 
2

 SO 
4

 ): A fast-acting, excellent choice for vegetable gardens. Apply according to package directions.

Wood Ash: If you have a clean source (no treated wood), wood ash is rich in K, but it will also raise the soil pH, so use sparingly if your soil is already alkaline.

Watering Check: Ensure your soil is not waterlogged, as excessive moisture can hinder nutrient uptake.

C. Monitoring:

New Growth Check: Monitor the new growth at the top of the plant. Since Potassium is mobile, the plant will move it from old leaves to new ones. New leaves should emerge green and healthy within 1-2 weeks of treatment.

Note: The already-damaged old leaves will likely not recover their green color but will continue to support the plant until they naturally die off.

Title: "Why Your Tomato Leaves Are Getting Yellow" üçÖ

"Hello, farmer friend! Your tomato plant is telling us it's hungry for a special food called Potassium.

The Sign: When the old, bottom leaves turn yellow, but the tiny lines (veins) stay green, that means your plant needs Potassium.

The Fix: You need to give your plant a fertilizer that has a lot of Potassium in it. Ask for 'Potash' or fertilizer for 'flowering' or 'fruiting' plants.

How to Apply: Mix it with water and pour it around the base of the plant.

Watch: The new leaves at the top will start growing strong and green again! Give it a little time to work."

4. Safety & Prevention: Long-Term Crop Health Tips
A. Soil Health:

Compost is Key: Regularly incorporate well-rotted compost into your garden beds. Compost slowly releases a balanced set of nutrients, including Potassium, ensuring long-term soil fertility and buffering against nutrient lock-up.

Avoid Over-Fertilizing Nitrogen: Excessive application of Nitrogen (the 'first number' on the bag) can interfere with the plant's ability to take up Potassium and cause similar-looking deficiencies. Always use a balanced fertilizer according to the plant's growth stage.

B. Crop Rotation:

Rotate Your Crops: Tomatoes are heavy feeders. Do not plant tomatoes in the exact same spot year after year. Rotate them with lighter-feeding crops like beans or peas. This helps replenish specific nutrients and breaks the cycle of soil-borne pests and diseases.

C. Mulching:

Apply Mulch: Use an organic mulch (like straw or wood chips) around your plants. Mulch helps stabilize soil temperature, conserve moisture, and as it breaks down, it slowly contributes organic matter and nutrients to the soil.
