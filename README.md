# EcoGuard- AI Crop Health Advisor (Plant Doctor)OverviewThe AI Crop Health Advisor is a single-page React application designed to provide early diagnosis and treatment plans for plant diseases. By simulating input from computer vision (image analysis) and voice assistants, it leverages the Gemini API with Google Search grounding to give farmers, gardeners, and agricultural experts quick, reliable, and actionable advice.The core goal is to reduce crop loss, improve productivity, and address communication barriers through structured, easy-to-understand reports suitable for conversion into educational videos and voice prompts.Technology StackFrontend: React (JSX)Styling: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN)AI/Backend: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) with Google Search GroundingPersistence: Firebase/Firestore (Used for mandatory authentication and user identification only)FeaturesSymptom Analysis: Users input a detailed description of plant symptoms (simulating input from a photo and voice).Grounded Diagnosis: The AI model searches the web to provide a reliable diagnosis and treatment plan based on current, real-world data.Structured Report: Results are categorized into four clear sections:Diagnosis: The likely issue and urgency.Treatment Plan: Step-by-step resolution.Educational Content: Simple scripts for illiterate users (simulating AI videos/voice).Safety & Prevention: Long-term crop health tips.Accessibility Focus: The report structure supports downstream features like AI-animated videos and voice-based assistants to overcome literacy and language barriers.How to Run the AppSince this application is contained within a single .jsx file and uses standard React/Tailwind/Firebase structures, it is designed to run in environments that support modern JavaScript modules and React compilation.PrerequisitesYou need a working environment capable of running modern single-file React components.Usage InstructionsOpen the File: Load the PlantDoctorApp.jsx file into your React environment (e.g., a local development server or an online code sandbox).Input Symptoms: In the provided text area, describe the visible symptoms of your sick plant (e.g., "The tomato plant leaves are yellowing, and I see small black spots").Get Diagnosis: Click the "Get Diagnosis" button. The application will contact the Gemini API, process the request, and display the detailed report.Review the Report: Examine the four sections (Diagnosis, Treatment, Education, Safety) for comprehensive guidance.AI Configuration DetailsThe application uses a strict systemInstruction to ensure the AI's output is structured and suitable for agricultural advice:SettingValuePurposeModelgemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20Fast and capable model for complex reasoning and structured output.ToolGoogle SearchEnsures the diagnosis and treatment recommendations are current and factually grounded in real-world agricultural knowledge.PersonaAI Plant Pathologist and Agricultural AdvisorGuides the tone and expertise of the response.Development NotesAPI Key: The const apiKey = "" is an intentional placeholder. In the canvas environment, this is automatically injected at runtime.Firebase: Firebase initialization and authentication (__initial_auth_token and __firebase_config) are included to satisfy platform requirements for multi-user capabilities, although no data is actively saved in Firestore in the current version.Responsiveness: The layout uses Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive design, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices.
